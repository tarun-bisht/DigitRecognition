# Handwritten Digit Recognition
- A Web Application developed with Tensorflowjs recognize handwritten digits(0-9).
- It is done using Convolutional Neural Network. 
- User will have to write a digit in pad provided and it will inference what digit was written. 
- This project provide basic structure for creating machine learning based web applications.
- The model used here was trained in python with tensorflow then model was converted to tensorflowjs model. This trained model is hosted in firebase hosting [Here](https://models-lib.web.app/models/mnist_digits/model.json).
- Inferencing from model is done in client side using javascript with tensorflowjs.
