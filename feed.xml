User will have to write a digit in pad provided and it will inference what digit was written. This project provide basic structure for creating machine learning based web applications. The model used here was trained in python with tensorflow then model was converted to tensorflowjs model.</subtitle><author><name>Tarun Bisht</name></author></feed>
